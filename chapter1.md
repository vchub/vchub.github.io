# Chapter 1: The Pythagorean Theorem

The Pythagorean theorem describes a fundamental relationship between the three sides of a right-angled triangle. It states that the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

The formula is expressed as:

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$

Here, $c$ represents the length of the hypotenuse, and $a$ and $b$ represent the lengths of the other two sides.

For example, if a triangle has sides of length $a=3$ and $b=4$, we can calculate the hypotenuse $c$ as follows:

$$
3^2 + 4^2 = c^2 \\
9 + 16 = c^2 \\
25 = c^2 \\
c = \sqrt{25} = 5
$$

This is a classic example of a 3-4-5 triangle.
